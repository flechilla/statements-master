# Type Definitions and Usage Guidelines
## üß© Type Definition Best Practices

1. **Prefer `type` over `interface`** unless declaration merging is required
2. **Use TypeScript utility types** (`Omit`, `Pick`, `Partial`, etc.) where appropriate
3. **Document your types** with JSDoc comments to explain their purpose
4. **Never use `any`** - create proper type definitions
5. **Keep types focused** - each type should have a single purpose
6. **Use readonly** for immutable properties

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Duplicating types in multiple locations
2. Creating overly complex generic types
3. Using `any` instead of creating proper types
4. Not documenting complex types
5. Creating circular dependencies between type files
