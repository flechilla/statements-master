**Task:** Document the new feature’s architecture, implementation strategy, and integration details. Your documentation should provide a clear overview of the feature, highlight key architectural components, and include sample code that demonstrates core implementation concepts. Focus on presenting the general picture of how the feature fits into the overall system. If necessary, perform internet searches to gather additional details on specific topics, technologies, or packages relevant to the implementation.

   - Describe the new feature and its purpose.  
   - Explain the business problem it addresses and the value it adds.

2. **Architecture Overview**  
   - Present a high-level description of the feature's architecture.  
   - Identify the major components, modules, and interactions within the system.  
   - Include architecture diagrams or flow descriptions if applicable.

3. **Key Components and Modules**  
   - List and describe the main components or modules involved.  
   - Explain the responsibilities of each component and their communication patterns.

4. **Implementation Details**  
   - Detail the technical design and key implementation decisions.  
   - Explain how the new feature integrates with the existing codebase and architecture.  
   - Describe any new services, APIs, or data models that are introduced.

5. **Code Samples**  
   - Provide representative code snippets to illustrate the implementation.  
   - Ensure the code is well-commented and highlights critical sections of the feature.  
   - Focus on snippets that demonstrate core logic and integration points.

6. **Integration and Testing Strategy**  
   - Describe how the feature will be integrated into the current system.  
   - Outline the testing approach, including unit tests, integration tests, and any end-to-end test plans.

7. **Impact on Existing Architecture**  
   - Detail any modifications or extensions to the current system architecture.  
   - Discuss potential risks or challenges and strategies for mitigating them.

8. **Future Considerations**
